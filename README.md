# Caesar Cipher Program

## Introduction
The Caesar Cipher Program is a simple yet effective tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher technique. This Python-based script provides an interactive experience, allowing users to input their messages and choose a key for the cipher, ensuring a personalized level of security.

## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Offers users the ability to encrypt messages using a shift key and decrypt messages that were previously encrypted using the Caesar cipher.
- **Customizable Key**: Users can choose any shift key from 0 to 25, providing flexibility in the encryption process.
- **Character Preservation**: The script maintains non-alphabetic characters unchanged, ensuring the integrity of the original message.

## Getting Started
